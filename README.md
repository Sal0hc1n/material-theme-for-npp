![Material Theme Dark for Notepad++](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naderi/material-theme-for-npp-loglang/master/material_theme_npp_screenshot.png)

## Requirements:
  * This style is based on Monaco font (https://github.com/todylu/monaco.ttf).
  * Notepad++, of course.

## Installation:
Copy the Material-Dark.xml file to "%APPDATA%\Notepad++\themes" and in a portable installation to "%Notepad++%\themes".

Or simply import it to Notepad++ by going to Menu -> Settings -> Import -> Import Style theme(s) option.

# LOGlang

    Download [this](https://github.com/Sal0hc1n/material-theme-for-npp-loglang/blob/master/LogLang.xml) XML file
    Import the file: Language → Define your language... → Import
    Restart the application.

Files with `.log` extension automatically use this syntax highlighter, but you can always activate it manually: `Language → Log` file.

This configuration was written for Java logging (Log4J, Logback etc.), but it can be easily customized to work with other log patterns. Use the same dialog to adjust the colors and/or keywords, no XML hacking needed.
